# C 和 C++

的区别

> 原文:[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-c-and-c/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-c-and-c/)

**[**C**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c/)**和** [**C++**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/) **的相似之处是:**** 

*   **这两种语言有相似的语法。**
*   **两种语言的代码结构相同。**
*   **这两种语言的编译是相似的。**
*   **它们共享相同的基本语法。几乎所有的 C 的操作符和关键字也出现在 C++中，并且做同样的事情。**
*   **C++的语法比 C 稍有扩展，但基本语法是一样的。**
*   **两者的基本内存模型都非常接近硬件。**
*   **两种语言中都有相同的栈、堆、文件范围和静态变量的概念。**

****[**C**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c/)**和** [**C++**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/) **的区别在于:**
C++可以说是 C 的超集，C++中主要增加的特性有[面向对象编程](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-programming-in-cpp/)、[异常处理](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/exception-handling-c/)和丰富的 C++库。****

****下面是 C 和 C++的差异表:****

| C | c++ |
| --- | --- |
| C was developed by dennis ritchie in AT&T Bell Laboratories from 1969 to 1973. | C++ was developed by bjarne stroustrup in 1979. |
| C does not support polymorphism, encapsulation and inheritance, which means that C does not support object-oriented programming. | C++ supports [polymorphism](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/polymorphism-in-c/) , [encapsulation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/encapsulation-in-c/) and [inheritance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inheritance-in-c/) , because it is an object-oriented programming language. |
| Is a subset of C++. | C++ is a superset of C. 。 |
| C contains 32 [keywords](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/variables-and-keywords-in-c/) . | C++ contains 63 [keywords](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cc-tokens/) . |
| For code development, C language supports [programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-programming-paradigms/) . | C++ is called a mixed language, because C++ supports both [procedural](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-programming-paradigms/) and [object-oriented programming paradigm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-programming-paradigms/) . |
| Data and functions are separated in C language because it is a procedural programming language. | Data and functions are encapsulated together as objects in C++. |
| C does not support information hiding. | Data is encapsulated and hidden to ensure that data structures and operators are used as expected. C++ support |
| Built in data types, | Built-in & User-defined data types. |
| C is a function-driven language because C is a procedural programming language. | C++ is an object-driven language because it is object-oriented programming. |
| C language does not support function and operator overloading. | C++ supports overloading of functions and operators. |
| C is a function-driven language. | C++ is an object-driven language. |
| The function in C is not defined inside the structure. | Functions can be used inside the structure of C++. |
| Namespace features do not exist inside C, | [Namespace](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/namespace-in-c/) is used by C++ to avoid name conflict. |
| The header file used by C is [stdio.h](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/whats-difference-between-and/) . | The header file used by c++ is [iostream.h](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basic-input-output-c/) . |
| C does not support reference variables. | C++ supports reference variables. |
| C does not support virtual and buddy functions. | [T0】 c+++supports virtual and [friend functions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/friend-class-function-cpp/) . |
| C does not support inheritance. | C++ supports inheritance. |
| C focuses not on data, but on methods or processes. | C++ focuses on data, not methods or procedures. |
| Provide [malloc ()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-memory-allocation-in-c-using-malloc-calloc-free-and-realloc/) and [calloc ()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-memory-allocation-in-c-using-malloc-calloc-free-and-realloc/) functions for [dynamic memory allocation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-memory-allocation-in-c-using-malloc-calloc-free-and-realloc/) , and [free ()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-memory-allocation-in-c-using-malloc-calloc-free-and-realloc/) functions for memory deallocation. | C++ provides [new operator](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/new-and-delete-operators-in-cpp-for-dynamic-memory/) for memory allocation and [deletion operator](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/new-and-delete-operators-in-cpp-for-dynamic-memory/) for memory deallocation. |
| C does not support direct support for exception handling. | [T0】 c+++supports exception handling . |
| [T0】 scanf() 【T1] and printf () functions are used for input/output in C,](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scanf-and-fscanf-in-c-simple-yet-poweful/) | [CIN and cout](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basic-input-output-c/) are used for [input/output in C++.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basic-input-output-c/) |
| C structure has no access modifier. | C ++ structures have access modifiers. |
