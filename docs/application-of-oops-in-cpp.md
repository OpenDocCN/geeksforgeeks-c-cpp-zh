# OOPs 在 C++中的应用

**OOPs** 代表[面向对象编程](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-programming-in-cpp/)。它是关于创建包含数据和函数的对象。与过程语言相比，面向对象编程有几个优点。随着面向对象程序设计更快更容易执行，它变得比像 [C++](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/) 这样的过程语言更强大。OOPs 是现代编程最重要、最灵活的范式。它在模拟现实问题时特别有用。下面是 OOPs 的一些应用:

*   **Real-time system design:** Real-time system inherits complexity and is difficult to build. Object-oriented technology makes it easier to deal with these complexities.
*   **Hypertext and hypermedia:** Hypertext is similar to regular text because it can be easily stored, searched and edited. On the other hand, hypermedia is a superset of hypertext. OOP also helps to lay the framework for hypertext and hypermedia.
*   **AI expert system:** These are computer applications developed to solve the complex problems of the superhuman brain. Object-oriented programming helps to develop such an artificial intelligence expert system.
*   **Office automation system:** These systems include formal and informal electronic systems, which mainly involve information sharing and communication inside and outside the organization. OOP also helps to formulate the principles of office automation.
*   **Neural network and parallel programming:** It solves the prediction and approximation problems of complex time-varying systems. OOP simplifies the whole process by simplifying the approximation and prediction ability of the network.
*   **Stimulation and modeling system:** Complex systems are difficult to model because of the large variation of variable specifications. Simulating complex systems requires clear modeling and understanding of interactions. OOP provides a suitable method to simplify these complex models.
*   **Object-oriented database:** The database tries to maintain a direct correspondence between the real world and database objects, so that the objects can keep their identity and integrity.
*   **Client-server system** : The object-oriented client-server system provides the IT infrastructure for creating object-oriented server Internet ( **OCSI** ) applications.
*   **CIM/CAD/CAM system** : Object-oriented programming can also be used to manufacture and design applications, because it can reduce people's workload. For example, it can be used when designing blueprints and flowcharts. In this way, it is possible to make these flow charts and blueprints accurately.
