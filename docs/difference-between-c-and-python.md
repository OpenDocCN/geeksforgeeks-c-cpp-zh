| C | 计算机编程语言 |
| --- | --- |
| An imperative programming model is basically followed by C 。 | An object-oriented programming model is basically followed by Python. |
| Declared in the variable c, | Python has no declaration. |
| C there is no native OOP. | Python OOP, which is part of the language. |
| Pointers are available in C language. | There is no pointer function in Python. |
| C is a compilation language. | Python is an interpretation language. |
| c。 | There are a limited number of built-in functions. There is a large library of built-in functions in Python. |
| The realization of data structure needs to clearly realize its function. | With the built-in insert and append functions, it is easy to realize the data structure in Python. |
| C is directly compiled into machine code, which is directly executed by CPU. | Python is first compiled into bytecode, and then interpreted by a large C program. |
| Declaring variable types in C language is a necessary condition. | There is no need to declare the types of variables in Python. |
| C has no complicated data structure. | Python has some complicated data structures. |
| C is of static type. | Python is dynamically typed. |
| The syntax of C is more difficult than python, which is why programmers prefer to use python instead of C
 | It is easier to learn, write and read Python programs than C. |
| C program is to use. Extension C. | Python programs are saved by. Extension py. |
| One row allows assignment. | Assignment gives an error in line. For example, a=5 gives an error in python. |
| It is difficult to test and debug in C language. | In Python, testing and debugging are no more difficult than in C. 。 |
| More complicated than C Python. | It's much easier than Python. |
| The basic if statement in C is expressed as: [T0】 if () |

The basic if statement in Python is represented as: 
if: The basic if-else statement in Python is represented as: 
if ( ) 

其他

The basic if-else statement is represented as: 
if : 

否则:

c 语言速度快。Python 编程语言速度很慢c 使用{}来标识单独的代码块。Python 使用缩进来识别单独的代码块。每个语句的结尾都必须用 c 语言的分号来标记。在 Python 中，用分号来标记每个语句的结尾并不是强制性的。
